Welcome to scMINER documentation!

**scMINER** (**s**ingle-**c**ell **M**utual **I**nformation-based **N**etwork **E**ngineering **R**anger) is a computational framework designed for **end-to-end** analysis of single cell RNA-seq data. Using [**mutual information**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_information) to measure cell-cell similarities and gene-gene correlations, scMINER is widely applicable and highly accurate in unsupervised clustering and gene activity inference of scRNA-seq data.

In this documentation, we will walk you through every analysis that scMINER can do and introduce you more about the concepts related to scMINER framework.
